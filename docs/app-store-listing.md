## Description (4000 characters max)

League Keeper helps you run Magic: The Gathering budget leagues from your phone. Add players, set up multi-week tournaments, and track pods, placement, and achievements in one place.

RUN LEAGUES YOUR WAY
• Create tournaments with your chosen number of weeks and optional random achievements per week.
• Add and manage players, then mark attendance each week.
• Add new players mid-league and they join that week's pods.

PODS & SCORING
• Generate pods (groups of 4) for each round—shuffled for round 1, then by weekly points for later rounds.
• Record placement (1st–4th) and award placement points (4 for 1st down to 1 for 4th).
• Track custom achievements: add your own, set points, and mark "always on" or rotate them weekly.
• Save each pod with one tap; undo the last saved pod if you make a mistake.

STANDINGS & STATS
• View weekly standings after each round set and final tournament rankings.
• See per-player stats: wins, placement points, achievement points, and games played.
• Review past tournaments and standings anytime.

BUILT FOR ORGANIZERS
• No account required—all data stays on your device.
• Simple flow: New Tournament → Add Players → Attendance → Pods → Standings.
• Clear empty states and hints so you always know what to do next.

Whether you run a store league or a kitchen-table budget league, League Keeper keeps scoring fair and standings clear.
